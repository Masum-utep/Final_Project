**********Iterative method for solving system of linear equation******

This program computes the unknowns for system of linear equation. We have two 
coefficient matrix and constant matrix in seperate file. Those are problem1.dat
and problem2.dat. These two file contains the matrix dimension and elements as
 well. 
 
 Please make sure that in your folder these four items are available:
 	1. Gauss.cpp
 	2. Gauss_header.h
 	3. problem1.dat
 	4. problem2.dat
 To compile the code you need to type following in your terminal:
 
 $ g++ -o Gauss Gauss.cpp
 
 And to run the output file:
 
 $ ./Gauss
 
 Thank you very much to play with this.
